# #1
## What does code confidence mean to me?

---

## There are three types of projects that every programmer deals with during their career

---

#  1. New / green field projects

<!--
- Start from scratch, no code (yet)
- No architectural decisions have been made (yet)
- No frameworks or libraryâ€™s chosen (yet)
- No Code styles have been chosen
- List of requirements and timescales

-->

---

# 2. Legacy / brown field projects

<!--
- It could have a mixture of code styles
- It could have mixture of frameworks and library's
- The code could be out of date
- It could be using an older version of PHP
- Team members who advocated a coding style may no longer be on the team
- Low documentation
-->

---

# 3. Migrations / rebuilds

<!--
- Migrating from one code style to another
- Migrating from one framework to another
- Migrating from versions which us different code conventions
-->

---

# The dream

---

# New projects

Start clean, continue clean whilst building up confidence with the codebase

<!--
- Be aware of known style violations before the first deployment
- Gain visual feedback on what parts of code need adjusting before the first deployment.
- Spot potential future gotchas in coding conventions.
- Create a CI that reports code violations quickly and blocks the pipeline from going forward.
- Ensure the team follows the same set of rules.
- Move quickly whilst ensuring the team comply with a given set of agreed coding conventions.
- Create a space for discussions about code conventions
-->
---

# Legacy projects

Quickly identify existing style violations whilst building up confidence with the code

<!--
- Be aware of known issues and violations in the project.
- Prioritise existing code smells
- Reduce team arguments on coding conventions. 
- Make it easier for future developers to know which conventions are required.
-->

---

# Migrated projects

Ensure the migration from one code base to another is as smooth as possible.

<!--
- Ensure old code standards can be easily adapted.
- Remove old code styles (Either defined or implied)
- Minimise the amount of cross pollination of styles.
-->

---

# How do we get there?

---

# Add PHP_CodeSniffer to your toolbox

<!--
- PHP_CodeSniffer is just one of many tools
- Mess detection
- Compatibility checks
- Static analysis
- Tests (Unit/Integration/Acceptance)
-->
---

# What about PHP Coding Style Fixer?

- Fixer first approach (Great for automation)
- Supported by Symfony
- Different output style
- Cannot ignore individual lines of code
- Configured by PHP
- Only checks PHP

---

# #2 What are Code Conventions?

---

# From Wikipedia

"Coding conventions are a set of guidelines for a specific programming language that recommend programming style, practices, and methods for each aspect of a program written in that language. These conventions usually cover file organization, indentation, comments, declarations, statements, white space, naming conventions, programming practices, programming principles,"

---

# What does that mean?
<!--
- It forces code to adhere to a given set of rules (sniffs).
- It makes the code easier to read.
- It removes ambiguity of which convention is allowed.
- It reduces noise and debate in pull requests.
-->
---

# What's the point?

<!--
We read code more than we write code.

When we write code we read the surrounding code, the calling code and the architecture.

Switching between conventions is a brain drain.

-->

# What's a sniff?
<!--
- A sniff is a file checks one part of the coding standard.
- A coding standard is a collection of sniffs.
- A coding standard is a directory and a ruleset.xml
- The default standard is PEAR
-->
---

# What's a ruleset?

[https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki/Annotated-Ruleset](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki/Annotated-Ruleset)
<!--
- XML file of that configures the coding standard
- Can define include and exclude rules
- Can include output rules
- Can include sniffs from other rulesets
-->
---
# Creating a ruleset

`./custom_ruleset.xml`

`phpcs --standard=/path/to/custom_ruleset.xml /path/to/file.php`

---

# Add a rule

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<ruleset name="MyProject">
  <rule ref="PSR1" />
</ruleset>
```
---
# Adding other rules

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<ruleset name="MyProject">
  <rule ref="PSR1" />
  <rule ref="PSR2" />
</ruleset>
```
---
# Rule parts

```
Standard.Subset.Sniff.ErrorCode
```

```
PSR2.Classes.ClassDeclaration.OpenBraceNewLine
```
---
# Excluding parts of a rule

```xml
<rule ref="PSR2">
    <exclude name="PSR2.Classes.ClassDeclaration.OpenBraceNewLine" />
</rule>
```
---

# Overriding parts of a rule
```xml

<rule ref="Generic.Files.LineLength">
  <properties>
    <property name="lineLimit" value="90"/>
    <property name="absoluteLineLimit" value="100"/>
  </properties>
</rule>
```
<!--
Includes LineLength sniff but changes settings so the sniff will show warnings for any line longer
than 90 chars and errors for any line longer than 100 chars.
-->

---
# Messaging
```xml
<exclude-pattern>*/vendor/*</exclude-pattern>
<rule ref="Generic.Files.LineLength">
    <message>The line is too long</message>
  <properties>
    <!-- default line limit is 120 -->
    <property name="lineLimit" value="170"/>
  </properties>
</rule>
```
<!--
Excludes the vendor directory
-->
---

# Excluding patterns
```xml
<exclude-pattern>*/vendor/*</exclude-pattern>
<rule ref="PSR2">
    <exclude name="PSR2.Classes.ClassDeclaration.OpenBraceNewLine" />
</rule>
<rule ref="Generic.Files.LineLength">
  <properties>
    <!-- default line limit is 120 -->
    <property name="lineLimit" value="170"/>

| MYSOURCE CODING STANDARD: PROPERTY DECLARATIONS |

Property names should not be prefixed with an underscore to indicate visibility.  Visibility should
be used to declare properties rather than the var keyword.  Only one property should be declared
within a statement.  The static declaration must come after the visibility declaration.

# #4
## How to increase code confidence using PHP_CodeSniffer

--- 

# Recommendations for any project

---
# Test order is important

PHP_CodeSniffer -> PHPStan -> PHPUnit

<!-- Run PHPCS first as this will require automatic alterations to the code -->
---

# One command
```bash
$ make tests
```
```bash
$ composer test
```
---
# Use Continual Integration (CI)
<!--
- Enforce that no code can be merged into the main branches unless the CI fully passes
-->
---
# Only test your code
<!--
- Don't check code that you haven't written.  
- Don't include the vendor
- Ignore any code that is automatically generated like migrations
-->
---

# Recommendations for new projects

<!--
- Do not ignore lines, files or disable sniffs unless you really have to.
- Document why you are ignoring things.
-->

---

# Recommendations for legacy projects

<!--
- Choose to use PHP_CodeSniffer or PHP CS 
- Investigate which conventions are currently in use
- Get an agreement with the team as to which conventions to use/drop
- If anything needs to be ignored then write a ticket and add the ticket reference into the comment.
-->
---

# Example

```php
// [PORT-123]
// phpcs:ignore Squiz.Arrays.ArrayDeclaration.SingleLineNotAllowed
$foo = [1,2,3];
bar($foo, false);
```
---

# 4# Confidence levels for legacy projects

---

# 1) PHP_CodeSniffer is already in use. 

Any ignored files or lines have been documented with a related ticket in the backlog

- High confidence level

---
# 2) PHP_CodeSniffer is installed
However lots of files/lines/sniffs have been ignored with no explanation

- Low confidence level

---

# 3) PHP_CodeSniffer is not installed

- Very low confidence level

---
# How do you improve a legacy project?
<!--
- Collate all the ignored files, lines and have a meeting with the team to discuss a way forward.
- Can the ignored items be fixed and the rule be included
- Start very slowly with goal to get better linter over time

-->

---
1. Get the buy in of the team.
2. Choose the standards and run PHPCBF over the code base to fix quick wins.
3. Document the standards that you are using.
4. Start to introduce new sniffs and re-run PHPCBF over the codebase each time.
5. Put the code formatting changes in a separate branch/pr.
6. Rinse and repeat.
<!-- 
In the document include a brief explanation as to why you chose the standard and provide examples.

Give this document to new starters.  

Pin this to slack, email it to the team and make sure everyone agrees.

Make it very obvious.
